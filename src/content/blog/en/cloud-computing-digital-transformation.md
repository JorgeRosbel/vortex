## Introduction: The cloud as a digital transformation engine

Cloud computing is no longer a mere technology option—it has become the foundation on which organizations build their digital transformation. This article explores how cloud services are redefining technology infrastructure, enabling unprecedented agility, and creating new business opportunities in the digital age.

## The evolution of cloud computing

### 1. From data centers to hybrid cloud

#### First wave: Virtualization
- Server consolidation
- Better resource utilization
- Lower infrastructure costs

#### Second wave: Public cloud
- On-demand elasticity
- Pay-as-you-go model
- Global scalability

#### Third wave: Hybrid and multi-cloud
- Environment integration
- Workload portability
- Cost and performance optimization

### 2. Cloud service models

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Compute, storage, and networking services
- Full control over the operating system
- Examples: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Development and deployment environments
- Managed middleware and operating systems
- Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)
- Complete applications delivered from the cloud
- Access from any device
- Examples: Salesforce, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace
